Image Classification with ResNet101

This project is a simple image classification web app built with Streamlit and TensorFlow. 

It uses the ResNet101 deep learning model, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on ImageNet, to classify images into various categories.



Features

Upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

The app processes the image and predicts the top 3 most likely categories using ResNet101.

Simple and interactive Streamlit UI for easy usage.



Difference Between ResNet50 and ResNet101

ResNet50 is a lighter model with fewer layers, making it faster for inference and suitable for real-time applications.

ResNet101 has twice as many layers, capturing more complex features and improving accuracy, but at the cost of increased computation.
